##ABOUT
netmonitor is a console application that monitors network interfaces.

It displays the transfer rate (upload and download) for each device and the data consumed by each device.

The main features of netmonitor are low resource usage, a simple yet effective design, and an easy to understand tabular output.

It also logs this data so that it can retain these values after a crash or restart.

It displays values whose units change dynamically to scale with the value.

##COMPILING
To compile netmon type the following commands

````sh
./configure 

make 

make install
````
